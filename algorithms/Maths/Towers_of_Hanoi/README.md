# Towers of Hanoi

Towers of Hanoi is a puzzle where we have three towers with n disks and what we need to do is move the entire stack of discs from one tower
to the other,taking into consideration the following rules:
1) We can move only one disk at a time.
2) We can move only the topmost disc from each tower.
3) We cannot place a bigger disc on top of a smaller disc.

### Input Format

We need to give the number of discs as an input

### Output Format

The output will give the status of each towers.

### Sample Input

```
enter the number of discs
5
```

### Sample Output

```
Tower 1->       1       2       3       4       5

Tower 2->

Tower 3->

 The status of towers after calling the function-

Tower 1->

Tower 2->

Tower 3->       1       2       3       4       5
```
